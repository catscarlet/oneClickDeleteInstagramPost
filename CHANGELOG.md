## 1.0.1

- Fix a visual issue.

Just add `style="word-break: break-word;` to fix the visual issue. It seems Firefox doesn't have this issue. It's just working. The `style="word-break: break-word;` has not been standardized. Well, It works well on Chrome, and Firefox just ingores it cuz nothing needs to be done. Well, I don't use Edge or any other browsers, so it'll be a pleasure if you can test it on other browsers.
